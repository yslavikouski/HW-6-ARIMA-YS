#explaining output
#auto arima gives us (1,1,0) model which means that it is a first-order autoregressive model with first-order differencing and no moving average; We have low coefficients on ar1 and drift (0.39 and 0.54); Standard error values are low but not very low; Variance of the residuals (errors) is 0.58 which is roughly 58%;The log likelihood is a measure of how well the model explains the observed data. In this case, the log likelihood is -67.77.The positive drift term (0.5432) suggests a general increasing trend over time. The model seems to be providing a reasonable fit to the data; The standard errors are relatively small, indicating relatively precise parameter estimates. Overall the model is reasonable
